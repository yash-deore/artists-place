> ### Smart contract Deployed at:

Polygon testnet: https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x0eC81f2A7538A9937d93B2E99E860260A4650dc6

## Run on localhost:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`

4. Run `npm start` to run the project on http://localhost:3000/

# The problem 🧑‍🎨Artist's place🧑‍🎨 solves:

## 1 . High Listing Prices:

`Low and constant Listing Price`, High listing prices take away from Lister’s profit. Artist’sPlace solves this by making the listing price less than a dollar `(0.00025 ETH)`.

## 2. Lack of Unique Art:

`Unique art`, NFT collections are very similar looking. This can be avoided by forcing the digital artist to fill a form before uploading every NFT.

## 3. High gas fees:

`Polygon`, Deploying smart contracts on polygon solves the issue. Gas fees are very low. In addition to that transactions are very fast.

## 4. NFT Flippers:

`Variable Royalties`, This can be solved by imposing high royalties on high profits and low royalties on low profits.
